**## Rules Implemented with Aizen's Raids & Discord
[Implemented Rules for Raids with Aizen Suske Raid Bot](PLACEHOLDER)


### üö™ Joining a Lobby, and then Backing Out
* I enforce this rule because I make a clear warning and give people the opportunity to DM me if it was a mistake. I have automatic alerts set up for this, but I still manually approve the ban. Usually, I just suspend the user to get their attention.
* Sometimes it causes the bot to play the entire raid by itself. The Umbreon is built like a tank with leftovers; it can take 10 minutes to go through a raid. (I haven't actually measured the maximum time, but I will find it or do a Ditto raid with 3 other people and not attack to time it.) This wastes my time, other players' time, costs money for electricity, and the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription, which is being wasted, as well as the Switch, computer, router/internet bill, and bandwidth throttling.

### üö´ Trainer/Pokemon Nicknames
* Nicknames that are advertising names, especially to websites that sell Pokemon, will get you banned. Any inappropriate names, remember it's still a game geared at kids, will also be banned.
* If it's from a website that sells Pokemon, I will usually just do it to get the player's attention and let them know, but if it continues, I'll ban them.

### üìù In-Game Name (IGN)
* Your in-game name needs to be in the server name or part of it - something that makes you easy to find. It's not a hard ask if you're using the bots - and 99.9% of the time it doesn‚Äôt matter. However, if we need to find you in Discord (since right now my bots only run in Discord and are not on Twitch), and it takes us too long, we'll just ban you to get your attention.

### ü§ñ Bot Enthusiast Role
* If you have used our bots before, either in our server or another server, or you plan on using our bots in our server or another server, make sure you claim the **Bot Enthusiast** role from the channel/role selection.
