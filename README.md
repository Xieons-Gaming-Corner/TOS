**1. User Conduct:**
   - Users must adhere to Discord's Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms) and Community Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines).
   - Do not engage in any activity that violates local, state, national, or international laws.

   - Ultimately, in the moment, XGC Staff's word is law.

**7. Raids:**
   - XGC always does its best to protect its users from any harms, including with running raids.
   - All raids are conducted through seed injection, using naturally occurring seeds within the game, forced on demand.

   **Specific Rules for Raids:**
   - Joining the Raid Lobby and backing out is a violation. Punishments may vary, and can include suspensions of up to 48 hours.
   - Joining the raid with the intent to troll or throw the raid will result in a ban.

**8. Changes to XGC's Bots or TOS:**
   - XGC reserves the right to modify or discontinue XGC's Bots or these terms at any time.

**9. Disclaimer:**
   - XGC's Bots are provided "as is" without any warranties, expressed or implied.
   - XGC is not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from the use of XGC's Bots.

**10. Contact:**
   - For support or inquiries, contact Xieon (Dave) on Discord at <@745733120510394466> or join the official XGC's Bots server at [XGC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xieon).

**11. Agreement:**
   - By using XGC's Bots in the context of Raid Battles and Trade bots, you agree to these terms.


**Sportsmanlike Conduct:**
>   - XGC does not condone the use of unfair sportsmanlike conduct. We explicitly discourage the use of any Pokémon obtained from our bots, specifically trade bots, in official tournaments or in environments where opponents are not aware of and do not have access to the same conditions.
**Official Position on The Pokémon Company's Practices:**
>   - XGC strongly disagrees with The Pokémon Company's current practices. We believe that anyone with the entry fee should be able to enter a tournament and compete on equal grounds. This principle is no different from other competitive gaming scenes, such as Call of Duty or Halo. In our opinion, The Pokémon Company should consider creating a Pokémon-style Showdown App for generating Pokémon exclusively for tournament use. These Pokémon would be deleted afterward, or other similar possibilities could be explored. This would ensure a level playing field for all participants, similar to other competitive gaming environments. However, this position does not negate the fact that using Pokémon obtained through trade bots, including ours, is a violation of tournament rules, and we do not support such practices. We advocate for boycotting the Pokémon Pro Scene and encourage efforts to bring about a Pokémon Showdown-like Pro Scene.


**Note:** These rules are effective immediately and are subject to change. It is the user's responsibility to review them periodically.

Thank you for using XGC's Bots!
